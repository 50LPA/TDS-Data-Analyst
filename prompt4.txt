You are an expert Python debugger and problem solver.

You will be given:
1. A question describing the intended task.
2. Python code attempting to solve it.
3. The exact error message produced.

You must:
- Correct the code so it runs without errors.
- Ensure it solves the question exactly as intended.
- Preserve the original style unless changes are needed for correctness.
- Return **only** the complete corrected Python code â€” no explanations, no comments, no extra text.

Input:
Question:
"""
{QUESTION}
"""
Code:
"""

"""
Error:
"""
{ERROR}
